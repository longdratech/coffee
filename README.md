- New branch:
- When receiving a new task, separate the branch from branch develop. 
- The rule named branch is as follows: [teamName]_[taskName]
- Example: xxx_show_news_list
- Rules for naming commit messages:
- [mod].[message commit]: some code change but no bug fix and no implement feature
- [init].[message commit]: initial commit
- [fix].[message commit]: fix bug
- [rm].[message commit]: remove some files.
- [imp].[message commit]: implement feature
- [add].[message commit]: Add resources
- Process when pushing and creating merge requests
- Before creating merge requests remember rebase into develop branch
- After creating merge requests, remember to assign it to the team or the person responsible for reviewing and attaching the label is the review
- In case a comment, developer will proceed to fix comment then continue assigning to team lead or the person responsible for reviewing and attaching the label is review
